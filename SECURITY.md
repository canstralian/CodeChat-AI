## Reporting a Vulnerability

The CodeChat AI team and community take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them by emailing security@codechat-ai.com or through the private security advisory feature on GitHub.

You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

### What to Include in Your Report

1. **Description of the vulnerability**
   - What type of vulnerability is it?
   - What is the impact?

2. **Steps to reproduce**
   - Detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability
   - Any specific configuration required

3. **Proof of concept**
   - Any code, screenshots, or other evidence
   - Please be responsible and don't expose sensitive data

4. **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
   - Any ideas for how to fix the vulnerability

5. **Your contact information**
   - So we can get back to you with questions

## Security Measures

### Application Security

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: We use parameterized queries and ORM
- **XSS Protection**: All output is properly escaped
- **CSRF Protection**: CSRF tokens are implemented where needed
- **Authentication**: Secure session-based authentication
- **Authorization**: Proper access controls throughout the application

### Data Protection

- **Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Password Security**: Passwords are hashed using secure algorithms
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with proper timeouts
- **API Security**: API endpoints are properly secured and rate-limited

### Infrastructure Security

- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration is stored securely
- **Database Security**: Database connections are secured and encrypted
- **HTTPS**: All production traffic uses HTTPS
- **Dependencies**: Regular security audits of dependencies

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Security

1. **Never commit secrets**
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data
   - Add secrets to .gitignore
   - Use tools like git-secrets to prevent accidental commits

2. **Input validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Use proper sanitization libraries
   - Implement server-side validation

3. **Database security**
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Never expose database credentials

4. **Authentication and authorization**
   - Implement proper session management
   - Use secure password hashing
   - Implement rate limiting

### Development Security

1. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Use `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities
   - Review dependency licenses

2. **Code review**
   - All code changes must be reviewed
   - Focus on security implications
   - Use automated security scanning

3. **Testing**
   - Write security tests
   - Test for common vulnerabilities
   - Use security linting tools

## Security Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We acknowledge receipt of your report within 24 hours
2. **Investigation**: We investigate the reported vulnerability
3. **Triage**: We assess the severity and impact
4. **Fix**: We develop and test a fix
5. **Disclosure**: We coordinate disclosure with the reporter
6. **Release**: We release the fix in a new version

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

- **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported
- **Day 1**: Acknowledgment sent to reporter
- **Day 7**: Initial assessment completed
- **Day 30**: Target for fix development
- **Day 90**: Public disclosure (if fix is available)
